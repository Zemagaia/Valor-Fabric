# Valor

A Minecraft Fabric exclusive mod. It is a direct take at translating the Valor gameplay loop to Minecraft, with elements heavily or lightly tweaked to fit the drastic genre swap. 

This mod is not meant to be a standalone mod, and rather to be ran in a modpack to help structure some of the systems that need to be in place to translate the MMO into minecraft. I would also rather not have to make up my own Cooking system to coexist with Minecraft when very well estabilished and quality mods such as Farmer's Delight exist for that purpose, for example.


I have plans on setting up a modpack once I have the core of this mod up and running.

## FAQ (What will probably be frequently asked anyway)

**Q:** What compelled you to make this mod?

**A:** Good question, not sure of the _real_ answer myself, really. I've always wanted to delve into Minecraft modding, though never really committed to any sort of project. I've also needed a way to learn programming that wouldn't exhaust me too fast or run the risk of ruining things. You can say this is a learning project I suppose.

**Q:** Why is there no support for Forge?

**A:** To put it bluntly, because I do not want to port it. I've had some very bad experiences trying to work with Forge in the past, which has left a very sour taste in my mouth when I have to work with it. I also simply do not want to maintain 2 different versions of the same mod. 

**Q:** Why try to translate Valor, a RotMG private server, out of all things?

**A:** I've played VotR/Valor since very early on, it's got its own special place in my heart. I've also worked on it in the past, but had to leave due to personal reasons, so this is a good way to work on it again, but in my own pace. I also enjoy the Minecraft aesthetic and I want a try and relaying Valor under it.


**Q:** Can you add _something_ from Valor into the mod?

**A:** Maybe. I've a pretty long list of things I want to add, so not sure when I will be able to tackle suggestions.

**Q:** Why is there no _something_ from Valor in the mod?

**A:** There's a lot of things in Valor, so it will take quite some time to add everything from it into the mod, a lot of things also need tweaks or complete remakes to fit in Minecraft. I also do not plan on supporting some systems I disagree with in Valor, like Shard Crafting.

**Q:** When do you plan on adding _something_ from Valor in the mod?

**A:** Probably ASAP. Check the [to do list](https://github.com/Zemagaia/Valor-Fabric/blob/main/todo.md), things at the top are higher priority.
